Active Shape Model for mean shape initialization with normalization
Global and local transforms
- global scaling and rotation
- local translation by indexing relative to closest facial point

Normalization of regression target?
- M(S^ - S(t)) # S^ is ground truth, S(t) is current estimate, M is normalization

Inverse transform?

Def: a normalized shape is the shape scaled and rotated to minimize square loss relative to the mean shape

ERT applies a shrinkage for the leaf nodes (which they term "bins") but makes less of a difference given more training data
We don't use covariance for selecting pixel features

ERT takes more care in selecting sample pool of pixel features (search "uniform")
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)

[Important] Why are there F thresholds and not 2^F?
- Because fern as opposed to tree?
